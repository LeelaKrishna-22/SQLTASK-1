# SQLTASK-1
This is a beginner-friendly project that demonstrates how to create and manage a Library Management System using MySQL and DBeaver. The database keeps track of authors, books, categories, library members, and book loans.

ðŸ§¾ Overview
This project includes the following six main tables:

Table Name	Description
authors	Stores information about book authors
books	Stores book details and links each book to a category
categories	Stores different categories of books
members	Stores information about library members
loans	Tracks which member borrowed which book and when it was returned
bookauthor	Junction table to manage many-to-many relationships between books and authors

The relationships between tables are managed using foreign keys. For example:

Each book has a category_id that refers to the categories table.

The bookauthor table links books to one or more authors.

The loans table references both book_id and member_id.
